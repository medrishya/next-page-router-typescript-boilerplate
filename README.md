## About the repository.

- This repository includes basic setup for a nextjs application with typescript. It helps avoid hassle to setup eslint, prettier, husky and lint staged into a freshly created nextjs application.
- Looking at the pnpm-lock.yaml file, you can clearly understand that we are using pnpm for package management. But you can use any package manager of your choice like `npm` or `yarn`. Make sure you remove pnpm-lock.yaml file after cloning and execute commands with package manager of your choice.
- Clone the repository and execute `pnpm i` to install the packages.
- Run `pnpm run dev` to start the development server.

The project inlcudes Airbnb's linting guidelines. Check .eslintrc.json file for more information.

### Note: Page router is used in this project instead of app router for nextjs version 14.2.3.
